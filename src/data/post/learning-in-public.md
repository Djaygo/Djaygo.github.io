## The Concept

Learning in public means sharing what you're learning as you learn it, rather than waiting until you're an expert.

> "The fastest way to learn is to teach."

## Benefits

### For You
- **Forces clarity** — You can't explain what you don't understand
- **Creates accountability** — Public commitment motivates follow-through
- **Builds connections** — Others on similar journeys find you
- **Creates a record** — Future you will thank present you

### For Others
- **Beginner-friendly** — Fresh learners explain things differently than experts
- **Shows the path** — Your struggles help others know they're not alone
- **Diverse perspectives** — Not everyone learns from the same sources

## How to Start

1. Pick a topic you're learning
2. Write about what you learned today
3. Share it somewhere (blog, Twitter, this garden)
4. Repeat

Don't wait until you're an expert. The best time to start is now.

## This Garden

This [digital garden](/digital-garden) is my practice of learning in public. Notes here are works in progress, growing over time as I learn more.
