## Why Obsidian?

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on local Markdown files. I chose it because:

- **Local-first** — My notes are mine, stored on my machine
- **Markdown** — Plain text that will last forever
- **Links** — Wiki-style links connect ideas naturally
- **Graph view** — Visualize connections between notes

## My Setup

### Folder Structure

I keep it simple:
- `inbox/` — Quick captures, to be processed
- `notes/` — Permanent notes
- `projects/` — Active project notes
- `templates/` — Note templates

### Plugins I Use

Essential plugins that enhance my workflow:
- **Daily Notes** — Start each day with a fresh note
- **Templates** — Consistent note structure
- **Backlinks** — See what links to current note
- **Graph View** — Explore connections

## Publishing to the Web

This [digital garden](/digital-garden) is built with Astro and syncs with my Obsidian vault. Notes written in Obsidian can be published here with minimal friction.
