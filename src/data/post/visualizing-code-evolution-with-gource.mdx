## The Story Your Code Tells

Every repository has a story. Not in the documentation or the README—but in the living, breathing history of commits, branches, and contributions. **Gource** transforms that invisible narrative into something visceral: an animated tree of files blooming, shifting, and evolving as contributors shape the codebase over time.

## Why This Matters

From a user experience perspective, visualization isn't just eye candy—it's **empathy infrastructure**. When you watch your commit history unfold:

- **You see patterns** you never noticed in `git log`
- **You feel the rhythm** of your development—sprints, quiet periods, bursts of refactoring
- **You understand the architecture** as an organic structure, not just folder hierarchies

This is what good UX does: it makes the invisible visible, and the abstract tangible.

## How I Created This

Copy and paste this command to generate your own Gource visualization:

<CopyCode
  filename="generate-gource.sh"
  lang="bash"
  code={`gource -1920x1080 \\
  --seconds-per-day 0.5 \\
  --auto-skip-seconds 0.5 \\
  --title "Your Project Name" \\
  --key \\
  --highlight-users \\
  --file-idle-time 0 \\
  --background-colour 0d1117 \\
  --font-colour 58a6ff \\
  --hide mouse,filenames \\
  --stop-at-end \\
  -o - | \\
ffmpeg -y -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - \\
  -vcodec libx264 -preset medium -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 18 \\
  ./gource-visualization.mp4`}
/>

### Breaking Down the Experience Decisions

| Option | UX Rationale |
|--------|--------------|
| `--seconds-per-day 0.5` | Compress time so the viewer stays engaged—nobody wants to watch paint dry |
| `--hide mouse,filenames` | Reduce visual noise; focus on the forest, not individual leaves |
| `--background-colour 0d1117` | GitHub dark theme—feels familiar, reduces eye strain |
| `--highlight-users` | Contributors are heroes; make them visible |
| `--key` | Always provide orientation; users should never feel lost |

### Convert to GIF

Want a GIF instead? Use this command after generating the MP4:

<CopyCode
  filename="convert-to-gif.sh"
  lang="bash"
  code={`ffmpeg -i gource-visualization.mp4 \\
  -vf "fps=15,scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen=max_colors=128[p];[s1][p]paletteuse=dither=bayer" \\
  -loop 0 \\
  gource-visualization.gif`}
/>

## The Experience-First Principle

Watching a Gource visualization of your own project evokes something unexpected—*pride*. You see the work accumulate. You remember that late-night refactor. You notice how the `components/` folder grew over time.

This emotional connection matters. It's the difference between "I maintain this code" and "I built this."

## Practical Applications

- **Onboarding new contributors**: Show them the project's history in 30 seconds
- **Retrospectives**: Visualize a sprint's impact on the codebase
- **Documentation**: Embed in READMEs for living project context
- **Personal motivation**: Remind yourself how far you've come

## What's Next

Consider pairing Gource with:
- **Audio**: Add a soundtrack that matches your project's energy
- **Captions**: Annotate major milestones as they appear
- **Comparisons**: Generate visualizations for different time periods

The command-line is a portal to your project's memory. Gource just makes that memory watchable.

## Tools Used

This post was created with the help of:

- **[Gource](https://gource.io/)** — Software version control visualization. Transforms git history into an animated tree showing files and contributors evolving over time.
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** — The multimedia Swiss Army knife. Encoded the raw PPM stream from Gource into a compressed H.264 MP4.
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Helped orchestrate the pipeline, craft the command, and write this post from an experience-first perspective.
- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** — The static site framework powering this digital garden. Ships zero JavaScript by default, perfect for content-focused sites.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** — The version control system whose history makes all of this possible. Every commit is a frame in the story.
