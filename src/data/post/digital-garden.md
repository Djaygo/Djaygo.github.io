## The Garden Metaphor

Unlike a traditional blog where posts are published complete and rarely updated, a digital garden is more like a real garden:

- **Seeds**: New ideas, quick captures, half-formed thoughts
- **Budding**: Ideas that are developing, connecting to others
- **Evergreen**: Well-developed notes that are regularly tended

## Why Garden?

Traditional blogs create pressure to publish polished, complete thoughts. Gardens embrace the messiness of learning and thinking in public.

Key principles:
1. **Growth over perfection** — Notes evolve over time
2. **Connections over isolation** — Ideas link to each other
3. **Learning in public** — Share the journey, not just the destination

## This Garden

This site is my digital garden. You'll find notes in various stages of development. Some are seeds I just planted, others are evergreen notes I return to regularly.
